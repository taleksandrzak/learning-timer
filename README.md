# learning-timer
This App is for managing the time of learning a particular topics. We can create topics that we want to learn. We can add a time we need to learn this topic and then time will be decrease or we can omit this time and then the time will be increase. 
We can plan a time for learning the topic. We can choose one of the method: 1) for every day the same period of time (one value); 2) the time period is different for weekday and for weekend (two values); 3) the time is different for every day (seven values). 
When we start the app, the logic detects the day and check the value of time for this day. When we start learning we click start. There is a progress bar and value in percent for this day and overall time for this topic.
The app calculate based on time that we decelerated the deadline for learning the topic.
